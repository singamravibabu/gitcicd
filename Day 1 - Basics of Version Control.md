# **Day 1: Basics of Version Control**

---

#### **1. Definition and Importance of Version Control**  

**What is Version Control?**  
Version Control is a system that helps track changes to files, typically source code, over time. It allows multiple people to collaborate on a project while keeping a history of changes, enabling easy reversions if needed.

**Key Benefits of Version Control:**  
- **Collaboration:** Multiple team members can work on the same project without overwriting each other's work.  
- **Change History:** Keeps a detailed log of all changes, who made them, and why.  
- **Backup and Recovery:** If something goes wrong, you can roll back to a stable version.  
- **Experimentation:** Developers can create branches to test new ideas without affecting the main project.

#### **2. History of Git and Introduction to GitHub**

**The History of Git:**  
- Git was created in 2005 by **Linus Torvalds**, the creator of Linux, to manage the Linux kernel's development.  
- It was designed to be fast, distributed, and capable of handling large projects efficiently.  
- Unlike centralized version control systems (e.g., Subversion), Git enables each developer to have a complete local copy of the repository.  

**Introduction to GitHub:**  
- GitHub is a cloud-based platform that allows developers to host and manage Git repositories.  
- It adds collaboration features like **pull requests**, **issue tracking**, and **project management tools**.  
- GitHub integrates seamlessly with Git, making it a preferred choice for individual developers and teams alike.

#### **3. Installing Git and Creating a GitHub Account**

**Step 1: Install Git**  
- Visit the [Git Downloads Page](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and choose the appropriate version for your operating system.  
- Follow the installation instructions for your platform:  
  - **Windows:** Run the installer and choose default settings unless specific changes are required.  
  - **macOS:** Use Homebrew (`brew install git`) or download the installer.  
  - **Linux:** Use your package manager, e.g., `sudo apt-get install git` for Ubuntu.  

**Step 2: Verify Installation**  
- Open your terminal (or Git Bash for Windows).  
- Run the following command to check the installed version:  
  ```bash
  git --version
  ```  

**Step 3: Set Up Git Configuration**  
- Configure your name and email for Git:  
  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
  ```  

**Step 4: Create a GitHub Account**  
1. Go to [GitHub's Signup Page](https://github.com/join).  
2. Enter your details (username, email, and password) and click **Sign up for GitHub**.  
3. Verify your email address to activate your account.  

**Step 5: Install GitHub CLI (Optional)**  
- GitHub CLI simplifies interactions with GitHub from the terminal. Install it from [GitHub CLI Documentation](https://cli.github.com/).

### **Hands-On Exercise: Your First GitHub Repository**

1. **Create a Repository:**  
   - Go to GitHub and click on **New Repository**.  
   - Give it a name (e.g., "version-control-basics") and choose "Public" or "Private."  
   - Click **Create Repository.**  

2. **Clone the Repository Locally:**  
   - Copy the repository's URL and run:  
     ```bash
     git clone <repository_url>
     ```  

3. **Add a File:**  
   - Navigate to the cloned directory and create a file (e.g., `hello.txt`).  
   - Add some text to the file and save it.  

4. **Commit the File:**  
   ```bash
   git add hello.txt
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Added hello.txt"
   ```  

5. **Push Changes to GitHub:**  
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```  

Now your changes are live on GitHub! ðŸŽ‰
